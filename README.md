A card game with a GUI

https://github.com/ajong003/COP3530-Project

Notes:\
CPU is buggy and primitive, only looks one step ahead(max damage)\
Scoreboard and Options not functional.\
Overall, code may be messy because we ran into unexpected time constraints due to our third member suddenly leaving without prior notice and any contributions whatsoever. \
We had hoped to be able to incorporate more advanced data structures and/or algorithms, but in the end we decided to allocate more effort into getting the main functions to work.

Contributions:\
Luis Gomez:  \
Alex Jong A Kiem: Card and deck structure and methods, CPU, Tweaking and linking GUI with card objects,  bug fixing
